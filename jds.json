Our key managers   \ncome from excellent educational backgrounds and have considerable experience in growing a \ncompany and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we are agile and able to \nadopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of larger industry players.  \n \nAs a part of our globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest \nsoftware engineering practices and fast development cycles, providing them with the opportunity \nto work on challenging technical problems that utilize innovative technologies for fast-paced \nsoftware delivery. Our collaborative and supportive work environment encourages innovation and \ngrowth, making our company an exciting and rewarding place to work. \n   \nExamples of few of our projects: \n\u2022 We built an analytics platform for a leading fintech company using Azure services, enabling \nthem to scale to 1000+ customers and provide self-service, near real-time analytics. Our \nsolution, based on Azure Synapse, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Data Factory, Azure \nDatabricks, and Power BI, followed the best practices of the Azure Well-Architected \nFramework, and leveraged migration strategies from Microsoft\u2019s Cloud Adoption Framework. \nOur automated deployment framework reduced setup time from days to hours. The platform \n now offers powerful self-service analytics, enabling their customers to reach millions of \nborrowers faster and easily integrate machine learning models for innovation. \n\u2022 We helped an organic supermarket chain migrate to Microsoft Power BI and Azure Synapse to \nimprove their reporting and data analytics capabilities. The previous system was time-\nconsuming, error-prone, and offered limited visualization and self-service capabilities. With \nthe new solution, the client can now perform direct queries between front-end Power BI \nreports and back-end data, enabling real-time insights and a holistic view across teams. \nAzure Synapse also provides higher data security. The migration resulted in automatic report \ngeneration, reduced operational costs, increased return on investment, and better business \ndecisions. \n\u2022 We developed a chatbot for the Arizona Department of Economic Security to improve its \nProgram Service Evaluator (PSE) training. The chatbot used Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services \nto answer PSE questions based on the policy manual of various state benefit programs. The \nchatbot learned from user feedback and crawled the policy content automatically. The \nchatbot increased evaluation efficiency, reduced senior staff time, and provided \nconversational responses to PSEs. The chatbot integrated seamlessly into the PSEs\u2019 workflow \nand was accessible through a web interface and Skype for Business. \n\u2022 Our client, a leader in the energy and utilities sector, needed a scalable solution to analyze \nlarge volumes of IoT data from diverse applications. We used Power BI and Azure Data \nExplorer to ingest, transform, and visualize semi-structured JSON data from network logs. Our \nsolution reduced the data refresh time, managed dynamic schema changes, and enabled \ncomprehensive analysis using Direct Query mode. Our client gained real-time insights and a \ncompetitive edge in the industry with our robust and effective solution. The solution also \nfacilitated efficient data ingestion and transformation, effectively tackled issues pertaining to \ndata refresh and dynamic schema of data. \n\u2022 We helped a multinational food and beverage chain to improve its sales forecasting accuracy \nby building a hybrid machine learning model on Azure Databricks. The model used historical \nsales, weather, and event data to predict future sales and analyze the impact of a range of \nfactors on sales. The model also detected and explained seasonal and daily spikes and lag \nperiods. Our model reduced the MAPE value from 0.13 to 0.09 and enabled the client to make \nbetter business decisions. \nTo read about some of our recent projects, visit https://maqsoftware.com/case-studies    \nA Typical Day: \n\u2022 8:30 a.m. - Start of Day: Your day begins in the office, setting the tone and preparing for the \nupcoming tasks. \n\u2022 9:00 a.m. - Global Management Meeting: You engage in discussions with the global \nmanagement team, which might include the Principal Consultant and key company \nmanagers.
